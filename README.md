# MPMB-UA23PT5-Content
Adds the content from *Unearthed Arcana 2023: Player's Handbook Playtest 5* to the MPMB Character Sheets.

**Detailed List of Script Content:**
- Adds the "Weapon Master" 4th Lvl Feat
- Adds six Epic Boon Feats:
-- Dimensional Travel
-- Energy Resistance
-- Irresistible Offense
-- Recovery
-- Speed
-- the Night Spirit
- Also included is an alternate form of the "Epic Boon of Irresistible Offense" Feat that operates as it was actually written in *UA23PT5*. This version of the Feat is set to be excluded by default, because as it was written in the original article, the bonus damage on a Nat 20 could be added to both weapon **AND** spell attacks, which seems unintended for a Feat that only increases Str or Dex. The version in the above list has been coded such that it only adds the bonus damage to weapons.

This encompasses all of the content in this UA article that wasn't superseded or removed in later content.

This script will allow users to more easily playtest the upcoming revision to D&D 5E.

**Known Bugs:**
- No known bugs at this time. Will update when any are found.
